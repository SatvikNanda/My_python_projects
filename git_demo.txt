BASICS OF GIT:

1. to configure when you log in for the first time

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

2. git init: to initialise git bash in a folder

3. git status: shows the status of files, whether they're added or modified or committed.

4. git add: to add the files

5. git commit -m"...": to commit the files with a message

6. git log: to see at what time you add, removed which files

7. git restore: to unstage the commit

8. git stash: if you made a few changes and you don't want to add them now, and you also want to keep the git status clean, then you can send these changes on the backstage.
They will wait there until they're called again.

9. git stash pop: to call the changes on the backstage back

9. git stash clear: to delete all the backstage changes
